                                <p>
                                    On my free time, I like to sound design.  I would argue that sound <br>
                                    design is one of the most important things about producing music. <br>
                                    I am capable of mastering and mixing all sorts of wave table sounds <br>
                                    and I love to experiment with my sounds.  I have been doing this for about 2 years.

                                <p>
                                    I started producing without knowing squat.  I didn't even know where the E key was on a piano. 
                                    I thought it would be fun to start producing, so I did.  I ended up really liking it.  I have made over 110
                                    completely original pieces of work.  <br>
